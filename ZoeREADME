Note for Zoe

Hey Zoe! 
In order to ensure you can properly access your mod with Curseforge, when creating a new profile, make sure the gamemode is set to Neoforge.
When we were setting up the Mcreators, yours got set up with neo unlike the standard of the others. This has no effect on your mod, and should
only affect this step of the download process

If you come across any complications, don't be afraid to reach out.
